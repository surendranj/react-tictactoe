# React Tic Tac Toe

A fully responsive tic tac toe game built with React, NextJs and Typescript.



The game AI has four modes:
1. Easy (Random moves by AI)
2. Normal (AI randomly chooses between optimal move from the minimax algo and a random move)
3. Hard (AI always choose optimal move)
4. Play against a friend (Alternate moves with a human player)
